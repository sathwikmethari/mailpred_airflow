## ðŸ“– Overview

This project provides a production-ready **Airflow DAG** that:

- ðŸ“¥ **Extracts** raw data from Gmail API.
- ðŸ—„ **Saves** the data.
- ðŸ§¹ **Transforms** & cleans the data for prediction.
- ðŸ¤– **Predicts** outcomes with a **Pre-Semi-Supervised** trained ML model.
- ðŸ“Š **Sends** Results for downstream analytics.

## âš¡ Workflow

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Extraction

- Used **Asynchronous Python** programming to make the extraction process faster and more efficient.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Loading

- Extracted data is compressed with **msgspec** and saved in local storage as backup.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Preprocessing

- Extracted gmail payload is cleaned using custom functions.
- Useful text data is extracted and then turned into tokens using **HuggingFace** pretrained transformers.
- Embeddings are then generated using these tokens.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Prediction

- XGboost model is trained on sample of manually labelled data.
- Using Semi-Supervised Learning, model is further trained on larger sample of data.
- Preprocessed data is fed into the trained model for predicting unimportant emails.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Trash/Deletion

- This is made to be a 2 step process as a fail safe.
- When the pipeline is manually triggered unimportant emails are sent to trash.
- When the scheduler triggers(i,e weekly) the pipeline, task to permanently delete emails in trash is executed.
