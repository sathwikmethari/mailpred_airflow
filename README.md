## ðŸ“– Overview
This project provides a production-ready **Airflow DAG** that:

- ðŸ“¥ **Extracts** raw data from Gmail API. 
- ðŸ—„ **Saves** the data.
- ðŸ§¹ **Transforms** & cleans the data for prediction.
- ðŸ¤– **Predicts** outcomes with a **Pre-Semi-Supervised** trained ML model.  
- ðŸ“Š **Sends** Results for downstream analytics.

## âš¡ Quick Start

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Extraction
- Used **Asynchronous Python** programming to make the extraction process faster and more efficient.
### ðŸ”¹ 2. Loading
- Extracted data is compressed with **msgspec** and saved in local storage as backup.
### ðŸ”¹ 3. Preprocessing
- Extracted gmail payload is cleaned using custom functions.
- Useful text data is extracted and then turned into tokens using **HuggingFace** pretrained transformers.
- Embeddings are then generated using these tokens.
### ðŸ”¹ 4. Prediction
- XGboost model is trained on sample of manually labelled data.
- Using Semi-Supervised Learning, model is further trained on larger sample of data.
- Preprocessed data is fed into the trained model for predicting unimportant emails.
### ðŸ”¹ 5. Deletion
- Used asynchronous python functions for faster and more efficient deletion.
